// cell capacity as a function of Open Circuit Voltage// for generic cell// This table is used at initial startup only to determine remaining cell capacity as// a fraction of full capacity, based on the open curcuit (no load, rested) cell voltage.// Please note that the cell must not have been charged or discharged for several// hours prior to this remaining capacity determination, or remaining capacity may// be considerabley in error
