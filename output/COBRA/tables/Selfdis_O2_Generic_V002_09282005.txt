// for generic cell

// This table is used to determine the cell self dischare rate, as a fraction of full capacity,
// based on cell temperature. Cell voltage also affects the self discharge rate, but it is not
// considered here, as cell temperature has a much larger effect

// table header:

5	//DO NOT CHANGE: word length of header (including this length)
1	//DO NOT CHANGE: control & 1: if input out of table, return table min/max as appropriate
1	//DO NOT CHANGE: number of axii
8	//x axis points: maximum of 20 points
1	//DO NOT CHANGE: 'y' axis entries per x axis
	
//x (independent) axis: temperature in 0.1C: must be in increasing order
//must be in increasing order: need not be evenly spaced
